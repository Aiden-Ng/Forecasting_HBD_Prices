# Forecasting_HBD_Prices

## Background and Overview
The continous rising of HDB (Housing and Development Board) price has become a significant barrier to homeownership for young Singaporean due to Singapore's limited housing supply. This issue has raised concern among Singaporeans. In this project, we aim to analyze trends and identify key feature contributing to high HDB prices. Additionally, we will forecast future HDB housing prices to provide actionable insights. These findings will empower stakeholders, including the government and urban developers, to make data-driven decisions aimed at addressing affordability and ensuring accessible housing for the boarder population.
